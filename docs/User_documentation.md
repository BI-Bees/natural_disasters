## User documentation

We have made a home page to display different types of graphs and a schema showing our data from where we made our graphs.

The home page is accesable [here](http://178.128.207.173:5001/)

We have four taps: Home,
Bokeh Bar Plots,
Pygal Bar Plots &
Data Set.

- [Home](http://178.128.207.173:5001/), shows the frontpage.

- [Bokeh Bar Plots](http://178.128.207.173:5001/bokeh_bar), (Should) show a graph of the total amount of natural disasters for each year.

- [Pygal Bar Plots](http://178.128.207.173:5001/pygal_bar), shows a graph of injured and deaths by a natural disaster each year.
Here you can hover over the graph to show the number of injured/deaths at the given year.

- [Data Set](http://178.128.207.173:5000/main_csv), shows a schema of the data we used. 
Here you can slide the 'year' bar to narrow down how much you wanna see in the schema.
